== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the image that appears for my posts shared on Facebook =

The plugin generates [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) markup for your site's webpages including an explicitly-specified image for posts with an associated [post thumbnail](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails). Your plugin or theme may define additional images through the `fb_meta_tags` filter. If an post thumbnail image exists your additional image will be an alternate for stories shared through a pasted link. Unattended story summaries use the first defined image.

= How do I moderate comments and add reviewers? =

The [Comment Moderation Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/comments) allows you to customize your Facebook application's moderators, blacklisted words, external logins, and more.

= Does Facebook Comments work with my existing WordPress comments? =

The [Comments Box social plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/) is meant to replace the WordPress commenting system with a more social, client-side experience.
