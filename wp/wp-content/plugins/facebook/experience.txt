WP
- No boilerplate plugin to get started (in the docs-- I did find hello.php though)
- Too many action hooks to parse
- Password strength indicator doesn't seem to work
- Prompted to upgrade akismet, but my FTP details require a cert (non-starter, it seems).
- http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages -> do_settings is do_settings_fields (and requires 2 fields, not 1) (oh, nevermind-- revised doc at http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Creating_Options_Pages&oldid=97268 -- this page is a mess)
- intermixing html and php kind of sucks (options page)
- confusing what action hooks and filters I should use
- IRC pretty helpful
- Need guides for building forms (for widgets and via menus)
- Not entirely clear when I should use actions vs filters

FB
- Why do I still get captcha’d when I create an app?  I’ve built on Platform for 5 years and have 100+ apps.
- BUG: Heroku doesn’t send intro email (https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=1012653)
- BUG: Can keep spinning up Heroku instances (https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=1012653)
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/ is long and daunting
- We don't have any sections for plugins (like PhoneGap, WP, etc)
- JS SDK init not consistent in all docs. E.g.,
<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=413161128711224";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>
- Open Graph tool and tutorials are daunting.  We need a 'quick and dirty' sample/tut.
- Bizarre scraper bugs: https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=1071278
- Really need to clean up product intro pages to be more high level, like https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/ (not saying this is perfect, but it draws you into the value prop)
- Not clear that tagging is meant for physical places
- PHP SDK examples are poor.  Not obvious how to do even simple things like publishing to the graph.  We need to spoonfeed developers.
- No easy way to develop what's sent via cURL in error_log (this is very useful for debugging).
- Posting to /feed/ doesn't get OG tags scraped
- Our Platform instrumentation isn't set up for this
- Our Platform is not set up for this type of dev (plugins)
- Like button pop in is really bad https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=484605#
- Our search API is nearly unusable-- this query takes ~20 secs to complete: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=platform&type=page&fields=picture,name,id,likes (https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=1082115)
- debugging PHP is big pain in the ass
