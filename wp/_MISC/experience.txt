WP
- No boilerplate plugin to get started (in the docs-- I did find hello.php though)
- Too many action hooks to parse
- Password strength indicator doesn't seem to work
- Prompted to upgrade akismet, but my FTP details require a cert (non-starter, it seems).
- http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages -> do_settings is do_settings_fields (and requires 2 fields, not 1) (oh, nevermind-- revised doc at http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Creating_Options_Pages&oldid=97268 -- this page is a mess)
- intermixing html and php kind of sucks (options page)

FB
- Why do I still get captcha’d when I create an app?  I’ve built on Platform for 5 years and have 100+ apps.
- BUG: Heroku doesn’t send intro email
- BUG: Can keep spinning up Heroku instances
- Why do we use mixed parentheses?
<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=413161128711224";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>



- Really need to clean up Getting Started pages to be more high level, like https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/ (not saying this is perfect, but it draws you into the value prop)
