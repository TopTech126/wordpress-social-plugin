WP
- No boilerplate plugin to get started (in the docs-- I did find hello.php though)
- Too many action hooks to parse

FB
- Why do I still get captcha’d when I create an app?  I’ve built on Platform for 5 years and have 100+ apps.
- BUG: Heroku doesn’t send intro email
- BUG: Can keep spinning up Heroku instances

- Really need to clean up Getting Started pages to be more high level, like https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/ (not saying this is perfect, but it draws you into the value prop)
